Hello there, good reader!

I wanted to present this great Keras-built ANN example, for demonstration. Artificial neural networks, machine learning and data science - so, so much can be said about these subject matters. It is truly a revolution, not only in programming, but for us as humanity. This discovery/technology/idea will lead us to a race of robots, in not so distant future. We have unlocked the secret of creative intelligence - one of the greatest discoveries we have made as species. We now know who we are, and how we think. 

And know how to recreate that - what's most important.

But let's look at this example.
